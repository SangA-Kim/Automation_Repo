*** This is not an error log ***
The existence of entities in this log does not signify that an error has 
occurred.  The purpose of this log is to provide a reason to you when a 
symbol has not been stubbed by VectorCAST.  When a link error occurs, the 
'Reason Not Stubbed' column provides an explanation.  In certain cases you 
may be required to provide a definition for certain entities in user code.  
Please consult the User's Guide for more information.
